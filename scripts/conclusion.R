"In general our discoveries on the relationship between wealth and obesity were unsurprising.
Although it requires more research, people who live in povertry or are relatively poor, struggle
more with purchasing healthier foods. For example, a meal at McDonald's cost only a couple of
dollars as compared to purchasing fresh produce at a grocery store may cost much more.

A surprising discovery we made from our analysis is the lack of correlation between state GDP and obesity rates.
We naturally assumed that richer states will have more funds to invest in public health, specifically in areas
that may reduce the state's obesity rates. Although, we see that the richer states do have a lower obesity rate,
we see a large spread of obesity rates for poorer states; some poorer states have one of the highest obesity rates
seen in the country, but we also see that other poor states also have the lowest obesity rates in the country.
This discovery made us want to explore the regional differences in obesity rates as well.

Rather than focusing on how wealth affects obesity rates, we wanted to look deeper into other potential factors
such as regional differences. We learned that the Southeast region had the largest obesity rate of 31%. Although, it
needs more research, a potential factor to this is the 'Southern diet' which contains a large amount of fried foods.
We wanted to find more data related to dietary habits and obesity rates, but we had trouble finding such data. Instead,
we wanted to look at the amount of attention obesity is receiving in each state through the number of legislation that is
introduced each year.
