objective <- "The main objective of this report is to present an in-depth analysis on known
               causes of obesity in the United States and the preventative measures issued by
               each of the 50 states to reduce obesity. The data that is specifically being looked
               at comes from the years of 2014-2017 and consists of two datasets: one having focus
               on the causes of obesity, and one focusing on policies put in place to reduce obesity.
               These combined provides a picture of the prevalence of obesity in the United States
               and if any of the measures enacted have been impactful.
               "
first_dataset <- "The first dataset comes from is from Federal Reserve as well and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis;
               Someone joined the data together and hosted it on Kaggle, from which we obtained this data. It presents 
               several different categories of analysis related to obesity, such as region, average incomes, obesity 
               rates, and poverty rate.

second_dataset <- "The second dataset we are incorporating into our research is from the CDC and maps out health topics and policies implemented that are related to the health topics. In particular,
               the scope of this report was narrowed down to health topics of obesity, so the data was manipulated accordingly.

analysis_pt1 <- "The first distinct section of the report, entitled 'Effects of Wealth on Obesity',
               involves the effects of wealth and income on 
               obesity. This is meant to examine any correlation between obesity rates and wealth."

analysis_pt2 <- "The second section of the report, 'Regional Differences on Obesity', analyzes the relationship between
                obesity rates and regions. It is meant to establish if there is any correlation between whether the
                location in the United States has an impact on the prevelance of obesity."

analysis_pt3 <- "Finally, in the last section, 'Effectiveness of Public Policy on Obesity', we wanted explore even further
                the potential differenes in state policies and how it may explain the regional differences in obesity rates.
                This section aims to develop a higher understanding of whether preventative measures
                and health policies that were enacted across the states have been beneficial in reducing
                obesity rates in the United States."
